Goals

Get used to using Redux to manage your application's state.

Understand the constituent parts to redux, namely:

actions (basically just objects)

action creators (basically just functions that return objects)

reducers (basically just functions that take the old state and an action as arguments, and return the new state)

Tasks

Build out your reducer and action creators to manage your shopping cart application.

Think carefully about how to manage stage and the best way to represent your application's state.

Think about any extra information you might want to hold in your state, such as price.
